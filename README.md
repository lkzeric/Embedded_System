# SSD Firmware Debug & Optimization Case Studies

This repository documents several case studies from my 4+ years of experience as a **Senior Firmware Engineer** in SSD controller IC development.  
The content focuses on **debug methodologies, optimization strategies, and embedded system concepts**, rather than source code, to protect intellectual property.


## 📖 Contents

- 🔧 **Debug Case Studies**
  - [Case 1] Unexpected Variable Underflow
  - [Case 2] Unexpected Performance Speed Drop
  - [Case 3] ARM Scatter File
  - [Case 4] Clock Uncoherency
  - [Case 5] Data Misalignment
  - [Case 6] CPU Abort Caused by unexpectedly Overwritting Stack Area
  - [Case 7] Data Misalignment after Power Cycle

- 🚀 **Optimization Examples**
  - [Example 1] Optimize the efficiency of flashing firmware 
  - [Example 2] Shorten the latency of firmware update
  - [Example 3] Optimize the placement of ARM Overlay to enhance the FW execution efficiency 

- 📚 **Conceptual Notes**
  - CPU
  - Normal Firmware
  - ROM Code
  - HW IPs
  - RAM



## 🖼️ Visualization
To make the concepts more intuitive, some explanations are supported by **figures and diagrams**:

- **The internal component relationships within an SSD**
- **NAND block erase latency comparison**
- **Function call optimization path (ATCM overlay usage)**



## 🎯 Key Takeaways
- Demonstrated ability to **diagnose and resolve complex firmware issues** in SSD systems.  
- Applied **systematic optimization strategies** to improve performance and reliability.  
- Experienced in **embedded systems, low-level firmware, and NAND flash management**.
